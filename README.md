- asumes dinosaurs can be uncaged. Decided there's a chance dinosaurs can be uncaged and lost, so the cage data needs
to be updated. A dinosaur might also pass away, so I think it would make sense to keep a dinosaur record with supporting
data but not be forced to belong to a cage.

- assumes we are not allowed to change species of a dinosaur. How would one mistake Tyrannosaurus for a Triceratops?
